// reading the file as stream is memory efficient, as no extra buffer is needed,
//      and we don't have to commit for the buffer size in advance.
// however - in a small banchmark I tried, the function call time changed from:
// 3ms - reading the entire file to buffer
// 27ms - reading the buffer as stream.
//
// this makes sense, but should be considered: memory vs. cpu time
// it might not always be the right solution

// TODO: can we use stdio buffering to speed things up?
